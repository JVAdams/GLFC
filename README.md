**GLFC** is a package of functions developed for the [Great Lakes Fishery Commission](http://www.glfc.org/)'s sea lamprey control program using the [R programming language](http://www.r-project.org/).

An example of how to use the functions in **GLFC** to estimate indices of adult sea lamprey abundance in the Great Lakes is given in this [vignette](https://rawgit.com/JVAdams/GLFC/master/vignettes/Adult-Index.html).

An example of how to use the functions in **GLFC** to estimate larval sea lamprey abundance in the St. Marys River is given in this [vignette](https://rawgit.com/JVAdams/GLFC/master/vignettes/DWEFES-Vignette.html).

You can access the functions by installing the package from within R.
