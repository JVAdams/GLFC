\title{Estimate Index of Sea Lamprey Adults}
\usage{
AIestimate(streamDat, minNMR = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{streamDat}{A data frame of old and new stream mark-recapture estimates
used to estimate the lake-wide Adult Indices,
typically the output from \code{\link{AIprep}}.  The data frame must
include: \code{year},
\code{lake}, lake-stream ID \code{lscode}
(see details), population estimate
\code{PEmr}, coefficient of variation \code{CVmr}
(100\% * sqrt(variance(PEmr)) / PEmr), \code{index}, a logical
identifying the index streams; \code{maintain} a logical identifying the
streams that will continue to have ongoing trapping even if not part of
the Adult Index; \code{indexContrib} a numeric, the stream population
estimate that will be used in the Adult Index (NA for new); and
\code{complete} a logical identifying streams and years for which the
Adult Index has already been estimated (FALSE for new).}

\item{minNMR}{An integer scalar greater than or equal to 2,
the minimum number of mark-recapture estimates
needed in a year to generate an index, default 2.}
}
\value{
A list with 3 components:
  \describe{
    \item{streamPE}{a data frame of stream mark-recapture and Adult Index
  contributions for the incomplete rows in \code{streamDat}, with
  the same variables as \code{streamDat};}
    \item{lakeIndex}{a data frame of annual lake-wide Adult Indices
  with 5 columns: \code{lake}, \code{year}, the Adult Index \code{index},
  and the lower and upper jackknifed range \code{jlo} and \code{jhi}; and}
    \item{lakeJackRaw}{a data frame of the raw contributions to the jackknifed
  range with columns for \code{lake}, \code{year}, and each of the index
  streams (see \code{\link{jackIndex}}).}
  }
}
\description{
Estimate the Adult Index of sea lampreys in a single Great Lake.
}
\details{
The annual Adult Index is simply the sum of stream population estimates for
  each year.  Missing stream estimates are estimated by a lake-specific
  ANOVA model relating the log of the stream estimates to the main effects
  of each stream and each year, weighted by the inverse of the CV squared.
  The jackknifed range is produced by recalculating the index,
  leaving out one stream at a time, then scaling up the result to the same
  scale as the Adult Index based on all streams.
